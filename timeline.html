Going to their home planet, SR388, she eliminates every Metroid in her path, seeing the different, more grotesque Metroid evolutions.
                It all leads to a final battle against the Queen Metroid, putting a definitive end to the metroid threat (kind of).
            </p>
            <p> After defeating the Queen, she encounters a newly hatched baby Metroid. That Metroid sees Samus as its mother, and quickly attaches itself to her. In the remake, Ridley tries to steal the baby, but is thwarted by the bounty hunter. The baby Metroid is then handed over to the Galactic Federation for research...</p>

Ridley appears, and steals the baby metroid, hoping to clone the species and use them as bioweapons. After the research station explodes, Samus follows Ridley to a rebuilt Zebes, 
                and fights her way through through the Space Pirates. It all leads to another confrontation with the vicious Mother Brain, now even stronger than before. Right as when hope is almost lost for Samus after a killing blow from Mother Brain, the baby Metroid uses the last of its power to help Samus, making her invincible and extremely powerful. With that, Mother Brain is defeated,
            and the metroid threat was subdued once more. </p>

                    to be hospitalized, with surgeons needing to remove her power suit, and give her a vaccine made from the baby Metroid. She is then sent to investigate the Galactic Federation's research center, as Samus' infected power suit started to mimic the hunter, and terrorize the researchers.
                    Dubbed the SA-X, she ventures through the research center, stalked by the SA-X. Now invicible to the X parasites due to the Metroid DNA inside her, she explores the lab, fighting multiple creatures, and finding a secret lab of Metroids, all guided by an AI version of her former mentor, Adam Malkovich. After the SA-X asexually reproduces and creates multiple versions of itself,
                    Samus and Adam decide to crash the research center into SR388, destroying the X on the station and the planet.

They decide to send specialized robots, called EMMI, to the source of video, planet ZDR.

                Her mission was to recover the EMMI, and eliminate the X parasites, however, things take a dark turn when a mysterious Chozo named Raven Beak catches her off guard, and all of a sudden, she wakes up in the depths of ZDR completely powerless.

She continues to explore the depths of ZDR, and finds out the EMMI want to extract her DNA, the X parasites are still alive, and that she has some of Raven Beak's DNA inside her.
                In the final confrontation against Raven Beak, she finds out about his nefarious plan to take over the galaxy, which leads to Samus unleashing her dormant Metroid DNA. She uses her newfoun power to obliterate Raven Beak, and escapes the planet as it explodes.
